EmuNotOstrich
=============

EmuNotOstrich is a foray into emulator development. In this particular project,
we will attempt to emulate the Gameboy Classic using Java. In this way, the code
will be easily portable and executable across platforms with minimal effort.

Development
-----------

EmuNotOstrich employs test driven development using the JUnit 4 test suite. Care is taken
to ensure test coverage is complete as possible, and that all classes pass prescribed tests.

Code will be as self-documenting as possible, but comments are interspersed if particularly
interesting (read: confusing) snippets must appear in the code base. OOP paradigms and design
patterns are implemented to improve maintainability and readability - performance isn't a
huge concern, since the hardware to be emulated is quite simple.
